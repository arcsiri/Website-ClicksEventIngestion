# Website-ClicksEventIngestion
We are developing a Python-based solution to simulate incremental customer clickstream data for a high-traffic website. The generated data will be continuously ingested through an end-to-end ETL pipeline into Databricks and Snowflake, enabling real-time analytics. This infrastructure will support the creation of dynamic dashboards in Tableau, providing actionable insights into user behavior and engagement.
